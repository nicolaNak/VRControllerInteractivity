# VRControllerInteractivity
A set of scripts to allow for easy set up of interactive VR experiences

A set of object interactivity scripts that can be overwritten to suit various needs
a controller script that touches, picks up and lets go of interactive objects with haptic feedback
text description and controller marker scripts for simple UI to identify items

These were used in my HenryVR exhibition and add onto SteamVR scripting in Unity. 
Works with SteamVR plugin v1.2.3
**These scripts will not work with plugin v2, I am aware and will update this when I have time**
